# 2025
This Repositery is for studying C++/C# Syntax studying and Programming methods, including projects from books and solutions to alogirthm problems

## Modern C++ Syntax
a continuation from 2024, Learning Modern C++ Syntax!
Version - C++20 

## C# Syntax
C# is well known and used various fields such as NET and Unity, i think it is best to learn C# after C/C++.

## Advanced Programming Methods
Most of C++ Programming Industries uses OOP and any other methods. 
in this year, im plan to learn more about Classes, Structuers, Polymorphism, Pointers, Inheritences.

## Algorithm Problems
To practice code or improve algorithm thinking, im solving problems from Leetcodes and any other programming quizs
